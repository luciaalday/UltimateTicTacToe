# UltimateTicTacToe

## A modified version of the game tic-tac-toe to allow for complex strategies
### The board consists of 9 boards within the classic board of play, where the square played within the smaller board dictates in which of the boards in the large square the next player can resume gameplay. The first player to win within a small board wins that square, and once one player wins three consecutive large squares the game is finished.

## Current: fully functional within python terminal
## Goal 1: Create tkinter interface for gameplay
## Goal 2: Make the game using java and classes (python version made before I learned of classes)
## Goal 3: Use java code to make game into graphic interface of play
